# OpenWater: A Citizen Science Water Quality Monitoring Platform
The goal of this project is to provide the bill of materials, design files, electronics, and firmware to allow you to build your own research grade turbidity meter. We hope that this work will help you to evaluate water quality in your local community through education or citizen science projects.
